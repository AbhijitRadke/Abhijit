            <p class="para">Multimeter is an electronic measuring instrument combines several measurement
                functions in single unit. Multimeter is used to measure the values of electrical quantities like
                resistance, voltage, current, capacitance, inductances. The different types of popular
                multimeter are available in market. Generally, digital multimeter is used to make measurement
                easier as digital multimeter show the readings directly on display. This helps to reduce human
                error in measurement. The most important drawback of multimeters is that, they are not easy
                to carry around .Another drawback is these measuring devices contain dial, switches, and
                tangled props which add complexity and difficulty in measurement.
                The aim of this project is to overcome these problems and make measurement easier.
                Arduino multimeter is an electronic measuring device which is small, portable and lightweight
                which can easily fit in to a pocket. Moreover it could be controlled using a application on a
                smart phone or computer and could be connected to these devices wirelessly. This reduces
                the use of unnecessary peripheral cables and switches.
                This project based on Arduino microcontroller and Android application. This device has
                a dimension which could easily fit in pocket and connected to the Smartphone via Bluetooth
                communication. The device is capable of measuring voltage up to 60 volt, current up to 1.5
                ampere, resistance value up to 1 M ohm, capacitance, temperature etc. All this measured
                readings is displayed on mobile screen through Android app via Bluetooth. This device helps
                to measure number of quantities in single unit and gives the result in real time with great
                accuracy. Moreover, this device has a very small size and is highly portable and easy to use.</p>
